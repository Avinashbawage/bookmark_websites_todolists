🚀 Bookmark Websites! 🌐



I've built a handy tool that allows you to easily bookmark your favorite websites with custom shortcuts. No more hassle of remembering long URLs or digging through browser bookmarks. 📚✨



The Bookmark Websites app lets you:



✅ Add shortcuts and corresponding URLs to create your personalized bookmark list

✅ Automatically fetches and displays website favicons for easy identification

✅ Simple and intuitive interface for seamless bookmarking

✅ Store your bookmarks locally, so they're always accessible



I had a great time developing this app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a fantastic way to improve your browsing experience and stay organized.
